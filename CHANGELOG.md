- Added support for downloading reports in both Excel (CSV/XLSX) and PDF formats directly from the frontend.

## Changed – 01-08-2025
- Refactored src/lib/export.js to support frontend PDF generation using jspdf:
- Supports auto-detection of columns when none are provided.
- Converts nested fields like userId.username into flattened columns for easier export.
- Removed backend /api/transactions/export/pdf route and its corresponding controller function (exportTransactionsReportPDF) to eliminate unused or conflicting routes.

- Resolved backend crash during server startup by ensuring all route handlers reference valid exported controller functions.
- Fixed PDF export functionality for Savings and Loans reports, which previously failed due to font issues and complex backend dependencies.

Removed – 01-08-2025
- Deprecated pdfmake usage in the backend in favor of frontend PDF rendering using jspdf, which is more portable and better integrated with the React UI.
- Removed exportTransactionsReportPDF() and exportSavingsReportPDF() from backend controllers to reduce maintenance complexity.
